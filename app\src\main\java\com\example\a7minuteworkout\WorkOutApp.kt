```kotlin
package com.example.a7minuteworkout

import android.app.Application

class WorkOutApp: Application() {

    // This is a lazy initialization of the database.
    // It means that the database will be created only when it is needed.
    // The 'by lazy' keyword tells Kotlin to create the database only when the 'db' property is accessed for the first time.
    val db by lazy {
        // This line gets the instance of the database.
        // If the database does not exist, it will be created.
        HistoryDatabase.getInstance(this)
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* The `WorkOutApp` class is the main application class.
* The `db` property is a lazy initialized instance of the `HistoryDatabase` class.
* The `HistoryDatabase` class is a database that stores the history of the workouts.
